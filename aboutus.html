                <h2 class = "bruddaTitle">David Choi</h2>
                <p class = "bruddaText">Hey, whats good y’all! I’m David and I’ve been constantly active starting from middle school, in which I was part of the Track and Field team pursuing Pole Vault. It’s always a passion for me to break my limits at whatever activity I am involved in. Now that I am in college, I am involved in BruddaStrong to improve my physical body performance and strength. </p>
                <p class = "bruddaText">I love working on my upper body as I always start the week with chest day. The chest is never big enough, haha. That doesn’t mean I am not unfamiliar with leg day because I had majority focused on legs during my time doing Pole Vault. Overall, I am trying to develop my body equally. </p>
                <p class = "bruddaText">My goals for the year of 2020 is to put on muscle to about 150 lb, compared to my current weight of 130 lb. It is difficult for me to gain weight, but it is not impossible if I put in the time and efforts. In terms of exercise, I want to be able to hit 185 lb on the bench, 250 lb on squats, and 265 lb on deadlifts. Hope to share my journey with you guys this coming year.</p>

                  <p class = "bruddaText"> What’s up, I’m Eric and although I have only started officially going to the gym since college, I’ve worked out consistently during my time on the waterpolo and swim teams in high school. I feel that BruddaStrong is a great way for me to keep going to the gym on a consistent basis during college and a channel to relieve stress as well. </p>
                  <p class = "bruddaText">I absolutely love working on arms, and I have even purchased a pair of dumbbells at home just to do curls every night. </p>
                  <p class = "bruddaText">My goals for 2020 are to achieve a 165 bodyweight and be able to consistently curl 30 lb dumbbells. I also want to be able to bench 105 lbs for 8 reps.</p>

Since then, I know I've improved a lot but I believe there is much yet to come. I've struggled to find time to hit the gym in college as a Computer Science major but this is something I am making a conscious effort to improve, and I hope I will be able keep myself accountable through BruddaStrong. </p> 
                      <p class="bruddaText">My favorite muscle groups to work out are chest and arms and my favorite exercises are bench press and bicep curls!</p>
